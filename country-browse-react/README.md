I created a web-page that fetches data about countries from an API. The project is inspired from Frontendmentor(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
To create this project I used SCSS for the front-end and React to display and create the functionalities.
